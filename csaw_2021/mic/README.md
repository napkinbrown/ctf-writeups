# Mic (Forensics)
> My Epson InkJet printer is mysteriously printing blank pages. Is it trying to tell me something?

Viewing `scan.pdf`, we get 34 blank pages. Neat

Opening it in a text editor, there's a lot of random bytes (to be expected)

Using binwalk on the pdf, there is a ton of compressed data:

```
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

```

Looking at some of the compressed data, they appear to be mostly fonts, so that's not especially helpful. After some googling, I found [qpdf](http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/), a CLI tool that does PDF transformations.

Using this, we can decompress the pdf into something more human readable:
```
qpdf --qdf --object-streams=disable scan.pdf out.pdf
```

`out.pdf` looks like this

```
%PDF-1.3
%ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
%QDF-1.0

Still not great, but a lot better. After some headers/fonts, we get to the content of page 1:

After digging through the [PDF specifications](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf) (page 133), we can see that the PDF is drawing very tiny curves in yellow all over the page. If we change the color from yellow to black, we get `mic_out_black.pdf`

After some more googling, we find these little dots are Machine Identification Codes (mic), something we were tipped off to from the start of this challenge. Printers often add these little yellow dots to the pages it prints as essentially metadata. The mic contains the date and time the pages was printed, the serial number of printer, and parody bits on the edges

Taking a look at the dots, the time fields stay the same, but the serial number changes every time. The serial number is read from top to bottom, and each number is read as two digets.

The first code is:
```
0000001 -> 01
0000010 -> 02
-> 0102, or "f" in ASCII
```

Reading the rest of the codes the same way, we get the flag: `flag{watchoutforthepoisonedcoffee}`
